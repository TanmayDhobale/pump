https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b50358b0-81ad-4f86-aaf0-1bf0e62e49e2

Core Requirements
Market Cap and Supply
Base Market Cap: $42,000.
Token Supply: 1 billion tokens.
80% of the token supply is sold via the bonding curve.
20% of the token supply is reserved for the liquidity pool (LP) after graduation.
Graduation Rules
A token “graduates” when its market cap reaches $100,000.
After graduation:
20% of the total supply is moved to the LP.
Liquidity is locked and burned to ensure safety.
Buy and Sell Fees
Deduct a 1% fee on both buy and sell transactions.
Send the fees to a designated fee wallet.
Price Restrictions
Set an initial market cap to ensure the token price does not exceed 3x its original value before graduation.
Real-Time Chart Updates
Track all buy and sell transactions and display them on a real-time price chart.
Update the chart dynamically with every new transaction.

Technical Specifications
Smart Contract Functionalities
Token Sales via Bonding Curve
Implement a mechanism to buy and sell tokens using a bonding curve, ensuring fair pricing.
Calculate prices based on the current market cap and token supply.
Fees Management
Deduct a 1% fee from all transactions.
Send the fee amount to a fee wallet address stored in the smart contract.
Allow the fee wallet address to be updated by the contract owner (to ensure flexibility if needed).
Liquidity Management
When the market cap reaches $100,000:
Automatically deposit 20% of the total token supply into the liquidity pool.
Lock and burn LP tokens to prevent rug pulls.

Frontend Features
User Dashboard
Allow users to:
Buy tokens using the bonding curve.
Sell tokens and view the expected return.
Display:
Real-time price and market cap.
Buy/sell transaction history.
Real-Time Price Chart
Visualize:
Current token price.
Buy/sell activity.
Use libraries like Chart.js or D3.js for dynamic updates.
Interaction with Contract
Use Solana's SDK (e.g., @solana/web3.js) to interact with the smart contract.

Implementation Steps
1. Smart Contract Development
Develop the smart contract on Solana	.
Key modules:
Token creation and minting.
Bonding curve pricing logic.
Fee deduction and transfer to the fee wallet.
Market cap tracking and LP management.
2. Fee Wallet Implementation
Add a fee wallet address as a configurable parameter in the smart contract.
Ensure that:
Fees collected from transactions are transferred to the fee wallet.
Only the contract owner can update the fee wallet address.
3. Frontend Development
Build a Frontend App for the user interface.
Use real-time data updates via WebSocket or RPC API calls.
Include a dynamic chart for buy/sell activity.
4. Testing and Deployment
Test functionalities on Solana’s testnet:
Verify token buying and selling.
Check fee deductions and transfer to the fee wallet.
Validate graduation conditions and LP handling.
